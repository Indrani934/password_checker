This tool checks your password against a database of common weak passwords.
It evaluates each password based on factors such as:
Number of Characters: Ideally, a password should have 16 to 20 characters.
Character Combination: A strong password includes a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters.
Uniqueness: Avoid using easily guessable information like your address or phone number.
Consecutive Letters/Numbers: Don’t use sequences like “12345” or “abcdef.”
Avoid Common Words: Steer clear of using the word “password” itself.
